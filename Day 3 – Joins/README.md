# Day 3 – Joins

## 1. Goal of the Day
- Understand SQL joins and how to combine data from multiple tables:
  - INNER JOIN – only matching rows
  - LEFT JOIN – all rows from the left table, with NULL for unmatched right table
  - RIGHT JOIN – all rows from the right table, with NULL for unmatched left table
  - FULL OUTER JOIN – all rows from both tables
  - CROSS JOIN – Cartesian product of two tables
- Apply joins in real-world scenarios (employees + departments)
- Build a portfolio-ready SQL file with hands-on practice.

## 2. Reflection & Certification Notes
- Learned to combine tables, filter rows before and after aggregation.
- Key skills:
  - Understanding different join types
  - Using table aliases for readability
  - Handling NULLs with LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER joins
