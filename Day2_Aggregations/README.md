## 1. Goal of the Day
- Learn SQL aggregation and filtering techniques:
  - `COUNT()` – count rows
  - `SUM()` – total of a column
  - `AVG()` – average value
  - `MIN()` / `MAX()` – lowest and highest values
  - `GROUP BY` – group rows for aggregation
  - `HAVING` – filter aggregated results
- Practice combining `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`.
- Start building portfolio-ready `.sql` files with comments and screenshots.

## 2. Reflection & Certification Notes
- Learned to summarize and analyze data using aggregation functions.
- Key skills:
  - Counting rows and computing averages
  - Grouping data by categories
  - Filtering groups with `HAVING`
  - Sorting results and limiting output
- Certification relevance: PostgreSQL Associate, BigQuery Analyst, Snowflake SnowPro, Synapse SQL exams.
